# Ability Project: 3D Model Generation from User Input

This project enables users to generate and refine 3D models through text and image inputs, using an interactive chat-based process. Designed with accessibility in mind, it empowers individuals—especially those with disabilities—to create custom, 3D-printable assistive devices and prosthetics tailored to their needs.
